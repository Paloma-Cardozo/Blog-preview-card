## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the blog preview card with a neat and responsive layout.
- See hover effects and transitions for interactive elements.
- Ensure the design is mobile-friendly and adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained valuable insights into:

- **Flexbox**: Improved my understanding of using Flexbox to center elements and manage layout structure efficiently.
- **Responsive design**: I focused on making the layout adaptable, although I plan to implement more responsive techniques in the future using media queries.
- **CSS transitions and hover effects**: I learned how to add subtle interactivity to my designs with smooth transitions on hover.
- **Semantic HTML**: This challenge reinforced the importance of using proper HTML elements to ensure accessibility.

Here’s a code example of my hover effect implementation:

  ```css
  .card:hover {
      box-shadow: 10px 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
      transform: translateY(-5px);
      transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
  }
  ```

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to focus on:

1. Advanced CSS techniques: I plan to explore more advanced CSS concepts like CSS Grid to create more complex layouts.

2. JavaScript integration: I would love to add some interactivity to future projects, like a dynamic content loader or animations.

3. Improving accessibility: Continuing to focus on making sure my projects are accessible by testing them with different screen readers and devices.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A great reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript best practices. I specifically used it to refine my understanding of semantic HTML and to improve my Flexbox implementation.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used it to incorporate the 'Figtree' font, which enhanced both the readability and visual appeal of my design.
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en) - This helped me understand how to properly stage, commit, and push changes, as well as deploy my project on GitHub Pages.
